# turtlebot4-traffic-light-detector-opencv-ros2

This ROS 2 project enables a TurtleBot4 to intelligently interact with its environment through:
-Traffic light detection (red, yellow, green) using an OAK-D Pro camera and OpenCV
-Real-time obstacle detection using a RPLIDAR
The goal is for the robot to stop at red lights, move at green, and safely avoid obstacles during navigation.

ðŸš€ Features
-Reliable traffic light detection using the OAK-D Pro RGB stream
-360Â° obstacle detection with RPLIDAR
-Real-time image processing using OpenCV
-ROS 2 integration (nodes, topics)
-Visualization available with rqt_graph

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
-ROS 2 Humble
-OpenCV (Python)
-OAK-D Pro 
-RPLIDAR A1M8
-TurtleBot4
-rclpy (Python ROS 2 client)

ðŸ§  Robot Behavior
ðŸ”´ Red light detected â†’ The robot stops
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow light detected â†’ The robot slows down
ðŸŸ¢ Green light detected â†’ The robot moves forward
ðŸš§ Obstacle detected by LIDAR â†’ The robot slows down, then stops
